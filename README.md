# Redux Toolkit and React Easy State POC

## [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - Redux Toolkit is state mutable and no manual action type creators

## [React Easy State](https://github.com/RisingStack/react-easy-state/) - React Easy State is state mutator without having setState called store and it also has render replacement method called view to render view but under the hood it uses React API's and saved developer time.
